  <h1>Starting Internship</h1>
  <p>Published on: November 24, 2024</p>
  <p>So now I started my internship. It was an indescribable experience</p>
   <h3>Day 1</h3>
   <p>Woke at 6.am, travelled to Abdullah Hukum LRT station, and took some time to find the location of the office.
    I was given a better laptop compared with mine. Wow! After that, I was told to learn some C# by using Microsoft and FreeCodeCamp's tutorial, I finished it in 1 day and got a certificate. 
    Pretty simple, then I was a given a PluralSight account to learn some more C#'s stuffs'.
   </p>
   <h3>Day 2</h3>
   <p>Ok now I realized that it was impossible for me to finish those topic in 1 day. The topics included: Debugger, Exception handling, LINQ,Asynchronous, Dependency Injection, ...
    Finished the Debugger and Exception handling.<br/>
    Revision:
    <pre>
        <code class="language-csharp">
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try{
                dosomething()
            }catch(Exception e) when (e is .. || ...){
                throw new Exception ...
            }
            finally{
                dosomething();
            }
        }
    }
}
        </code>
            </pre>
This is what I could recall... For Visual Studip Debugger, I only remember about set a breakpoint... I suddenly found out that the way i debugg is quite stupid as I only print out the value of variable. I guessed this a bad habit that I got when I participate in competitive programming. 

   </p>
   <h3>Day 3&4</h3>
   <p>Started LINQ, it is really a big topic for me... In my understanding, it is something similar to SQL statement. I think I have seen similar things in Laravel's 
    Eloqeuent but that is for database. LINQ is able to apply on list-like object or object that implements the interface "IEnumerable". 
    There are 2 types of LINQ, in method or query way. <br/>Example:
    <pre>
        <code class="language-csharp">
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> A = new List<int>{1,2,3};
            A = (from num in A  where num %2 ==0 select num);
            list = (from a in A orderby a.X descending,a.Y ascending select a).ToList();
            /*
            All,Any,Contains => EqualityComparer<T>
            list = (QUERY).All(lambda)
            */

        }
    }
}

        </code>
            </pre>
OK I could not remember all of it, but I think I know what is it talking about. When I am going to use it, I will tell ChatGPT to write for me or look at the Microsoft Documentation.
I remember that some of it should be pass a lambda function as input into it to be used. Besides, it support something like making a list then pass the list into another ... I forget where I got this already... But take note of it.
BTW, I think Microsoft's Documentation is better than Laravel's .
</p>

<h3>Day 5</h3>
   <p>Asynchronous Programming in C# really make me confusing... Although getting an A- in my Operating System, I still felt that 
    I didn't know Operating System. Process, threads, multithreading, asynchronous await, concurreny and parallelism ... these concepts
    still confusing me. I really had to relearn my Operating System. C#'s async and await looks similar to JS, but C# is support multithreading which means it is 
    really achieved multithreading. Besides that, C#'s Task also look similar to JS's Promise.
    
    <br/>
    Based on my understanding, async and await are like calling a very slow function and we had to wait for it, so we left and do other things first, then finally come back to collect result...
    An async void function should be an event-handle function, others should be async Task function... Therefore, can assume every async function as a task to be completed soon...
    Ok, I don't know what am I talking about, perhaps I still cannot get it. Really had to relearn my OS.
    <pre>
        <code class="language-csharp">
public static async Task Start(int i)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("thread " + i + " " + j);
    }

    // Async delay without blocking
    await Task.Delay(1000);  // Await the delay to simulate async work (like waiting for data)
}

static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    // Start the asynchronous tasks
    var x = Start(1);
    var y = Start(2);
    var z = Start(3);

    // Wait for all tasks to finish
    await Task.WhenAll(x, y, z);
}
        </code>
            </pre>
OK so from the example , I think this clearly show what I said...
